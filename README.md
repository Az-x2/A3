I haven't done much Website building but hopefully everything works as intended.
I had a lot of help from W3Schools. Their tutorials were helpful in getting what I wanted and while I did try to do my own coding.
They helped with the base of my website and I just added onto it. 

I started off the website with grabbing the tutorials of what I've wanted to use such as the slideshow and countdown.
I wanted to implement a Timeline however it kept clashing with my photo gallery so I just inserted an image and made do. 
I originally had the gif on the entire website, however I felt making it just the cover felt more smooth and looked better. I had a coloured image take place as the background afterwards. 
On Assignment 2, I had troubles with submission as I ended up with multiple files and it wouldn't work on other computers. 
However it worked on a different computer but it still gave me more files and did make a mess of my folder. 

Overall this assignment was better than the last one but I hope I can become a bit more independant.
